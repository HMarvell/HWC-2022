# HWC-2022
Hello World Challenge Part 1, created Nov 2022

This Repo, was created as a safe space for onboarding work that was completed as part of onboarding to an observability team.

Hello World Challenge, used to get basic concepts of the ELK stack and begin coding. The following image outlines task that need to be achieved by the end product, these tasks are not in order as the solution is not prescriptive and completion is not linear. Part of the challenge is not knowing where to start and where to finish, but to priorities the work load accordingly.
